# [Voice-Gender-Predictor](https://azdinebahloul-voice-gender-predictor-app-7gqn89.streamlit.app/)
This project was all about building a Gender Recognition by Voice app, using a Random Forest classifier algorithm with sklearn in Python. I used a dataset of voice features to train my model, so that it can predict the gender of a voice based on its characteristics. And I'm really happy to say that my model has an impressive 99% accuracy rate! To make things even more user-friendly, I also created a Streamlit app that lets users input their own voice data through sliders for different features, and then see the predicted gender. It's been a challenging but rewarding project, and I'm excited to see how it can be used in real-world applications.
